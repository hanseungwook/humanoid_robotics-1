1. What are the purposes of the following subdirectories in a ROS workspace?
	1. src
	2. build 
	3. devel
	4. log
	5. install

2. What is a ROS node?
A node is an executable file within a ROS package. ROS nodes use a ROS client library to communicate with other nodes. They can publish or subscribe to a topic, and they can provide or use a service.

3. What is a ROS package?
Packages are the software organization unit of ROS code. Each package can contain libraries, executables, scripts, or other artifacts.

4. roscore is started either through the command  roscore or whenever roslaunch is called. Doing
so will start up the following processes. Please explain what each of them do:
	1. ROS Master
	- provides naming and registration services to to the other nodes in the ROS system. It tracks publishers and subscribers to topics / services. Master enables nodes to locate each other, after which point they communicate with each other directly.
	
	2. ROS Parameter Server
	- is a shared, multi-variate dictionary that's accessible via network APIs. It's used by nodes to store/retrieve run-time parameters. Since it's not designed for high performance, it's best to store non-binary data such as config params. Parameter Server is globally accessible.

	3. rosout node
	- it's an ROS node used for subscribing, logging, and republishing of messages.

5. When should you use a ROS Topic? a ROS Service? a ROS Action?
	1. ROS Topic
	- when you have mutliple producers writing to, or multiple consumers reading from, a topic. Also when nodes aren't aware of each other.

	2. ROS Service
	- enables direct communication between two nodes. Use it when nodes are aware of each other's existence. 

	3. ROS Action
	- 

6. From within the bci_epxeriment_launch package find an example of each of the following:
	1. A parameter that will be placed on the ROS Parameter Server and what type of parameter it is.
	/use_gui, boolean

	2. The name of a package that is used by this system other than bci_experiment_launch.
	staubli_tx60

	3. The name of a node that is specified by one of the launch files and runs when this system is started.
	staubli_controller
