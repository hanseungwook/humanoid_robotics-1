# Part 1
1. List 5 properties of the Fetch robot you can access in rviz.

Robot state, fluid pressure, effort, illuminance, temperature

2. What is the difference between RViz and Gazebo? List three purposes of each with sources, and then three differences between each one with sources.

Purposes of Gazebo:
1. Design robots
2. Rapidly test algorithms on robots (path planning, grasping, etc)
3. Train AI system using realistic scenarios

Purposes of Rviz
1. See the robot state (movements, orientation, and etc) in real time
2. Visualize ROS topics 
3. See the environment of the robot, including objects and environment
properties like temperature

Differences:
1. Gazebo is the actual real world physics simulator where I get to set up
the world and simulate my robot; however, Rviz is only a visualization
software that allows me to view the Gazebo data or the real world data (when
using an actual robot rather than a simulation)
2. Only in Gazebo you are able to add objects and change the actual environment settings of the robot model, whereas in Rviz you cannot change such environment state.
3. Rviz has the interactive marker feature which makes selecting a certain area in 3D easy and allows one to adjust the robot's vision system manually while it is running.

3. How many nodes are running in the ROS network after you've run the commands under Command 1? Command 2? After RViz? Also how many ros topics are available for each of the following commands?

8 nodes are running after Command 1.
15 nodes are running after Command 2.

145 ROS topics are available after Command 1.
235 ROS topics are available after Command 2.

# Part 2 

1. What is the least number of navigation goalsrequired to have 90% of the environment built?
8 trials 

2. Display a PointCloud2 in RViz. Which topic displays what the robot is currently seeing using it depth camera? How many navigations are required from the beginning of the simulation to view the "FetchRobotics Logo"? Demonstrate that you can view thelogo during your demo and include a screenshot in your submission. 

'/head_camera/depth_downsample/points' topic displays what the robot is currently seeing using its depth camera 
4 navigations are required from the beginning to view the "FetchRobotics Logo"
